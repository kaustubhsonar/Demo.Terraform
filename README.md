# Demo Terraform

## Infrastructer as code
* Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. 
* IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way

### What problem IaC solve? 
* The pain of managing infrastructure. 
* Speed of deployment.
* Consistency 
* Accountability (If the failure happens in infra side infra code files hold the responsibility)
* Automation.
* Lower cost.

#### Types of IaC tools
